# Write to Clipboard

Prompts you to enter text and copies it to the system clipboard.

## How It Works

The flow opens an input dialog where you type or paste text. It copies that text to your clipboard and shows a confirmation message. You can then paste it anywhere with Ctrl+V.

No configuration needed — just run the flow.
