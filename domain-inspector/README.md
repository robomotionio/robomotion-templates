# Domain Inspector

Domain Inspector brings real time DNS and SSL intelligence directly into your Chat Assistant. Powered by Robomotion's Monitoring package and an AI Agent that performs automated tool calling, it transforms domain troubleshooting into a fast, hands free experience.

When you ask a question, the AI Agent interprets your request, selects the appropriate monitoring tool, queries live DNS or SSL data, and returns a clean, accurate answer within seconds. No switching tabs and no manual checks.

## What Domain Inspector can do

- Check SSL certificate validity, issuer details, and expiration
- Inspect DNS records such as A, MX, TXT, CNAME and more
- Retrieve live, real world data through automated tool calls
- Provide instant, reliable insights inside the chat

## Behind the scenes

The AI Agent processes your message using an advanced model like Gemini, decides which monitoring node to call, fetches the latest DNS or SSL information, and delivers a result that is ready to use. This setup makes your assistant a powerful automated problem solver for domain related tasks.
