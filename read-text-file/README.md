# Read Text File

Reads a text file from disk and displays its content in a message box.

## How It Works

The flow reads the full contents of the file at the path you specify and shows the text in a dialog box.

## Configuration

Open the **Config** node and set:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `msg.file_path` | Path to the text file | `"/home/user/notes.txt"` |
