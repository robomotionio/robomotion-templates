# BMI Calculator

Calculates Body Mass Index from weight and height inputs. A beginner-friendly template that demonstrates input dialogs and basic math.

## How It Works

The flow prompts you for your weight in kilograms (default: 70) and height in centimeters (default: 170), then calculates BMI using the standard formula `weight / (height/100)^2` and displays the result rounded to two decimal places.

No configuration needed — just run the flow.
