# Read From Clipboard

Reads the current text from your system clipboard and displays it in a message box.

## How It Works

The flow grabs the text content of your clipboard and shows it in a dialog. If the clipboard doesn't contain text (e.g., you copied an image), the error is caught and a friendly message asks you to copy some text first.

No configuration needed — copy some text, then run the flow.
